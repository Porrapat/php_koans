# PHP Koans

The **PHP Koans** walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn PHP.  
The goal is to learn the PHP language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries.  
We also teach you culture by basing the koans on tests.  
Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we live.  
Testing is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in PHP.

> _This project is inspired by Ruby Koans._
